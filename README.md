# üö® BlockEvid 3.0 ‚Äî Decentralized Evidence Management System

**BlockEvid 3.0** is a next-generation decentralized complaint and evidence handling platform built on Avalanche and Ethereum (Sepolia Testnet), with IPFS integration and role-based access control. It ensures secure, immutable, and transparent handling of complaints, evidence, and FIRs through smart contracts and decentralized storage.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/blockevid3.0.git
cd blockevid3.0
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Setup Environment Variables

Create `.env` file in root:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_AVALANCHE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0xYourAvalancheContractAddress
NEXT_PUBLIC_ETH_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0xYourEthereumContractAddress
NEXT_PUBLIC_PINATA_API_KEY=your_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_PINATA_SECRET_API_KEY=your_secret

## üèîÔ∏è Avalanche Integration

BlockEvid 3.0 leverages Avalanche's powerful blockchain infrastructure to enhance our decentralized evidence management system:

### Why Avalanche?

* **High Throughput**: Avalanche's ability to process 4,500+ transactions per second ensures our evidence system can scale to handle large volumes of complaints and evidence submissions without congestion.

* **Low Latency**: Sub-second finality means evidence timestamps and complaint registrations are confirmed almost instantly, critical for time-sensitive legal proceedings.

* **Cost Efficiency**: Lower transaction fees compared to Ethereum mainnet make the platform more accessible to all users regardless of financial resources.

* **EVM Compatibility**: Seamless integration with existing Ethereum-based tools and libraries while gaining Avalanche's performance benefits.

### Avalanche Components Used

* **C-Chain (Contract Chain)**: Our primary smart contracts are deployed on Avalanche's C-Chain, leveraging its EVM compatibility and high performance.

* **Avalanche Wallet Integration**: Native support for Avalanche wallets alongside traditional Web3 wallets.

* **ERC-20 Tokens**: Implementation of access tokens following the ARC-20 standard for role-based permissions.

* **Avalanche Network Parameters**: Optimized gas settings for Avalanche's unique consensus mechanism.

* **Fuji Testnet**: Development and testing environment before mainnet deployment.

By building on Avalanche, BlockEvid 3.0 achieves the perfect balance of security, speed, and scalability required for a modern evidence management system in the legal sector.
